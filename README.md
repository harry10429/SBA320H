# SBA320H

This project primarily utilizes useState and useEffect hooks to fetch and store data based on various requirements or range filters.

Initially, my idea for this project was to build a website that tracks weather conditions over the past 7 days but the limitations of free subscription plans made me a lot headache. so I decided to switch to an API that doesnâ€™t require an API key. This CheapShark API provides a list of games with parameters (eg. price caps and game title filters). My first approach was inspired by the style of gaming websites I remember from around 2010, which had a similar design. It is simple so I don't need to consider any further requirments or complex design.

Website link:
https://listofdealgame.netlify.app/

website only has two pages: home "/" and "/deals"

I was about to add some animations to carousel slides but struggling on adding new features to my code and website only provides limited number of game list or maybe I didn't justfiy the correct parameter
